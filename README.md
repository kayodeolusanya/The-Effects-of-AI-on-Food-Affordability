# 📊 Data Story: The Effects of AI on Food Affordability

### Using COVID-19 as a Benchmark for Measuring AI’s Real Impact

This project investigates how Artificial Intelligence has influenced **food affordability from 2017–2025**, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a baseline for global disruption. It combines data analysis, visualization, and narrative storytelling to explore how AI reshaped supply chains, pricing behaviour, and food accessibility.

## 📌 Summary of the Data Story

When COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, food systems became unstable worldwide. As shelves emptied and prices spiked, industries and governments increasingly turned to **AI-powered forecasting, logistics optimization, and automation** to restore stability.

This project uses the pandemic as a **benchmark** to evaluate what changed and how AI influenced the recovery period.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

* Some food categories became more stable due to AI interventions - but not all.
* **Post-AI (2022-2025)** volatility increased for several essential staples.
* Efficiency gains from automation did **not always translate into lower prices**.
* Technological access remains uneven - **small producers benefitted less**.
* Price trends reveal a **consistent upward shift** across many food categories after 2021.

---

## 🧮 Methods Used

* Monthly food prices (2017-2025)
* Yearly aggregation and smoothing
* AI-period grouping:

  * **Pre-AI (2017-2019)**
  * **During-AI (2020-2021)**
  * **Post-AI (2022-2025)**
* Volatility calculations (standard deviation)
* Category classification (e.g., meat, dairy, produce, grains)
* Narrative “scrollytelling” supported by visual analytics

---

## 📈 Visuals Included

* Price trends for Milk, Oranges, Eggs, Bread
* Category-level price trajectories
* Volatility and instability charts
* Products with the largest pre-AI vs post-AI price increases
* Category-level percentage change analysis

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This data story aims to highlight:

* How AI has actually affected food affordability
* Where AI improved resilience in food systems
* Where pricing remained unstable or worsened
* How vulnerable communities were affected
* What COVID-19 revealed about structural weaknesses in global supply chains

The project combines **analytics, empathy, and storytelling** to emphasize why responsible AI adoption matters for food security and long-term resilience.
